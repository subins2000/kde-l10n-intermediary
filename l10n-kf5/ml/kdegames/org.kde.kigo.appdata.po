"Kigo is an open-source implementation of the popular Go game. Go is a "
"strategic board game for two players. It is also known as igo (Japanese), "
"weiqi or wei ch'i (Chinese) or baduk (Korean). Go is noted for being rich in "
"strategic complexity despite its simple rules. The game is played by two "
"players who alternately place black and white stones (playing pieces, now "
"usually made of glass or plastic) on the vacant intersections of a grid of "
"19x19 lines (9x9 or 13x13 for easier games)."
