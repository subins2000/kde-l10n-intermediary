"Checkers is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One "

"adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately "
"beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) "
"by jumping over it.\n"
"Only the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only "
"diagonally into an unoccupied square. Capturing is mandatory. The player "
"without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the "
"game.\n"
"When a man reaches the crownhead or kings row (the farthest row forward), it "
"becomes a king, and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the "
"first man, and acquires additional powers including the ability to move "
"backwards. If there is a piece in a diagonal that a king can capture, he can "

"A Roman numeral is the name for a number when it is written in the way the "
"Romans used to write numbers. Roman numerals are not used very often today "
"in the west. They are used to write the names of kings and queens, or popes. "
"For example: Queen Elizabeth II. They may be used to write the year a book "
"or movie was made.\n"
"\n"
"  The building of the roman numbers is made up by an agglutination of "
"numbers (the thousands, joined with the hundreds, joined with the tens, "
"joined with the units → just like the arab decimal system). This "
"agglutination of numbers is interpreted as the sum of these particular "
"numbers (again → just like the arab decimal system: you add up "
"thousands+hundreds+tens+units, and you write the respective figures "
"combined).\n"
"\n"
"  Examples:\n"
"\n"
"  2394: we got a sum of 2000 (MM), 300 (CCC), 90 (XC) and 4 units (IV), so "
"we write this combined: MMCCCXCIV\n"
"\n"
"  MMMCMXLIX: we got first thousands (MMM=3000), then we got hundreds "
"(CM=1000–100=900), then we got tens (XL=50–10=40), and at last we got units "
"(IX=10–1=9), so we write this in the decimal system: 3949."
