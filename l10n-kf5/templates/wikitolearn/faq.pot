msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:4
msgid ""
"Imagine a world where educational material is freely available to everyone, "
"always up-to-date and written by thousands of experts and educators."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:6
msgid ""
"WikiToLearn is an open platform where students, researchers and key people "
"in the academia can create and refine notes and textbooks, tailored "
"precisely to their needs, and giving them the power to customize the "
"teaching beyond what traditional textbooks allow. Our philosophy inherits "
"from the very foundation of how science works. We believe that “Knowledge "
"only grows if shared” and we want learners to “Stand on the shoulder of "
"giants!”."

"WikiToLearn was founded in September 2015, when a group of students from the"
" University of Milano-Bicocca had the necessity to share their notes to "
"study for their exams. [https://meta.wikitolearn.org/Academic_institutions "
"Many different universities and research centers] from all around the world "
"have since decided to join."

"Legally represented by KDE e.V., and part of KDE, WikiToLearn was born as a "
"non-profit community and an open source project, which wants to provide free"

msgid "How do you ensure reliability?"
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:18
msgid ""
"Reliability of content is ensured through a simple, non-blocking review process.\n"
"Every page, after it is modified, is considered a draft. Experienced users with working knowledge on the topic can later review the course and ensure it is correct and well written, giving it a \"seal of approval\". The resulting PDF is later exported as \"reviewed version\", a copy is uploaded on Wikimedia Commons, and every user on the website can choose whether to download the last version available, or the last reviewed version."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:21
msgid ""
"All editors also have the possibility of assembling their own books, "
"specifying a precise revision of the content which they want to download. "
"This gives everyone the possibility to assemble their own books, even if "
"they don't have the reviewer privileges on our platform."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:21
msgid "What about different ways of explaining the same topic?"
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:24
msgid ""
"We support and encourage multiple courses for one same topic! We realize it "
"is a fundamental and enriching practice to see a topic from many different "
"point of views, and it is a behavior we want to encourage. This is why we "
"don't have a single reference course for a topic, but anyone is free to "
"create their own, explaining it from whichever angle they prefer."

"What differentiates WikiToLearn from other wiki projects such as Wikipedia, "
"Wikibooks, Wikiversity?"
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:27
msgid ""
"Wikipedia wants to create a free encyclopedia, not free textbooks. It is not"
" focused on academic learning and it is not optimized for it: it is a place "
"where you go to look up facts, not to learn."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:29
msgid ""
"Wikibooks and Wikiversity are projects which are indeed closer to us. There "
"are two main differences: our unique focus on learning and delivering the "
"best didactical experience, and the software development freedom to grant "
"our users the best experience possible."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:31
msgid ""
"Not being hosted by Wikimedia Foundation (and instead relying on similarly "
"resilient infrastructure from [https://www.garr.it GARR]) means we are not "
"subject to restrictions on the software, which we can customize for the best"
" book editing experience. For example, we integrate external elements in our"
" infrastructure, provide a PDF generation feature, and in general offer a "
"streamlined and compelling user experience."
msgstr ""

"We are also working to provide features which are very hard to integrate in "

#: faq.mw:38
msgid ""
"We focus on writing ONLY educational textbooks, no videos, no MOOCs, no "
"direct interaction with your teacher. We believe that there are projects and"
" software tools better suited for that job, and while we aim to integrate "
"with them, we have no intention of being a replacement."
msgstr ""

#: faq.mw:40
msgid ""
"The focus of WikiToLearn is on the collaboration: we believe that if everyone can contribute to a common knowledge, everybody benefits. And it is very hard, if not directly impossible, to do that with video editing and more advanced tools.\n"
"The outcomes that we want to achieve are high quality, evolving, exhaustive and proofread textbooks."
