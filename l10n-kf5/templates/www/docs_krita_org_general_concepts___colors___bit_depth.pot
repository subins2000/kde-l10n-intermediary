Where 16bit only allows coordinates like [1, 4, 3], 16bit float has coordinates like [0.15, 0.70, 0.3759], with [1.0,1.0,1.0] representing white. Because of the differences between floating point and integer type variables, and because Scene-referred imaging allows for negative values, you have about 10-11bits of precision per channel in 16 bit floating point compared to 16 bit in 16 bit int (this is 2048 values per channel in the 0-1 range). Required for HDR/Scene referred images, and often known as 'half floating point'."

Because of the nature of floating point type variables, 32bit float is roughly equal to 23-24 bits of precision per channel (16777216 values per channel in the 0-1 range), but with a much wider range (it can go far above 1), necessary for HDR/Scene-referred values.
