msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:82
msgid "It usually works by attempting to covert a color to the reference color space XYZ. XYZ is a coordinate system that has a spot for all colors that the average human eye can see."

msgid "Krita has two systems dedicated to color management. On the one hand, we have **lcms2**, which deal with ICC profiles, and on the other, we have **OCIO**, which deal with LUT color management."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:88
msgid "To give a crude estimate, ICC profiles deal with keeping colors consistent over many interpretations of devices (screens, printers) by using a reference space, and OCIO deals with manipulating the interpretation of said colors."

msgid "Within both we can identify the following color spaces:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:93
msgid "Device spaces are those describing your monitor, and have to be made using a little device that is called \"colorimeter\". This device, in combination with the right software, measures the strongest red, green and blue your screen can produce, as well as the white, black and gray it produces. Using these and several other measurements it creates an ICC profile unique to your screen. You set these in Krita's color management tab. By default we assume sRGB for screens, but it's very likely that your screen isn't exactly fitting sRGB, especially if you have a high quality screen, where it may be a bigger space instead. Device spaces are also why you should first consult with your printer what profile they expect. Many printing houses have their own device profiles for their printers, or may prefer doing color conversion themselves. You can read more about colorimeter usage :ref:`here <profiling_and_calibration>`."

msgid ".. image:: images/color_category/Krita-colormanaged-workflow_text.svg"
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:110
msgid "A typical example of a color managed workflow. We have input from scanners and cameras, which we convert to a working space that can be used between different editing software, and is converted to an output space for viewing on screen or printing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:112
msgid "In a traditional color managed workflow, we usually think in terms of real world colors being converted to computer colors and the other way around. So, for example photos from a camera or scanned in images. If you have a device space of such a device, we first assign said device space to the image, and then convert it to a working space."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:114
msgid "We then do all our editing in the working space, and use the working space to communicate between editing programs. In Krita's case, due to it having two color management systems, we use ICC profiles between programs like Gimp 2.9+, Inkscape, digiKam and Scribus, and OCIO configuration between Blender and Natron."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:116
msgid "You also store your working files in the working space, just like how you have the layers unmerged in the working file, or have it at a very high resolution."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:118
msgid "Sometimes, we apply aesthetic or 'look' spaces to an image as part of the editing process. This is rather advanced, and probably not something to worry about in Krita's case."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:120
msgid "Then, when we're done editing, we try to convert to an output space, which is another device space. This can be CMYK for printers or a special screen RGB profile. When you are dealing with professional printing houses, it is best to ask them about this step. They have a lot of experience with doing the best conversion, and may prefer to do the conversion from your working space to the device space of their printers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:122
msgid "Another form of output is the way your screen displays the color. Unlike regular output, this one is done all the time during editing: After all, you need to be able to see what you are doing, but your screen is still a device with a device space, so it does distort how the image looks. In this manner, you can see your screen as a set of binoculars you have to look through to see your image at all."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:124
msgid "Therefore, without a profiled monitor, you actually don't know what the actual colors you are working with are like, because the computer doesn't know the relevant properties of your screen. So if you profiled your monitor, give Krita the profile in the settings, and select the sRGB space to draw in, you are for the first time seeing the actual colors of the sRGB space."

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:133
msgid "When we paint from scratch, we can see our screen profile as the input space, because we use it to determine what colors to pick. This somewhat simplifies the workflow, but makes the screen profile and viewing conditions more important."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:135
msgid "Now, photographers and people who do a tricky discipline of VFX called 'color grading' will go completely mad over trying to get the colors they put in to come out 100% correctly, and will even count in factors like the time of day and the color they painted their walls. For example, if the wall behind your computer is pure red, your eyes will adjust to be less sensitive to red, which means that the colors they pick in the program could come out redder. We call these the *viewing conditions*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:137
msgid "Thankfully, artists have to worry a slight bit less about this. As illustrations are fully handmade, we are able to identify the important bits and make appropriate contrasts between colors. This means that even if our images turn out to be slightly redder than intended, it is less likely the whole image is ruined. If we look back at the kindergarten example above, we still understand what the image was supposed to look like, despite there being different colors on each image. Furthermore, because the colors in illustrations are deliberately picked, we can correct them more easily on a later date. Yet, at the same time, it is of course a big drag to do this, and we might have had much more flexibility had we taken viewing conditions under consideration."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:139
msgid "That said, for artists it is also very useful to understand the working spaces. Different working spaces give different results with filters and mixing, and only some working spaces can be used for advanced technology like HDR."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:141
msgid "Similarly, Krita, as a program intended to make images from scratch, doesn't really worry about assigning workspaces after having made the image. But because you are using the screen as a binocular to look at your image, and to pick colors, you can see your screen's device space as an input space to the image. Hence why profiling your monitor and giving the profile to Krita in the settings can help with preparing your work for print and future ventures in the long run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:143
msgid "Overall, it is kinda useful to keep things like viewing conditions in the back of your mind. Many professional artists use a mid-gray color as their default canvas background because they find they create much more dynamic images due to having improved their viewing conditions. It is also why a lot of graphics programs, including Krita, come with a dark theme nowadays. (Though, of course this might also be because dark themes can be considered cool, who knows.)"

msgstr ""

msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:162
msgid "These are fairly rare, and primarily used to describe printer profiles, such as CMYK. cLUT, or Color Look-up Table profiles store far more data than Matrix shaper profiles, so they can hold data of little particularities caused by, for example, unexpected results from mixing pigments. This is a far more organic approach to describing a color space, hence why a lot of programs that don't care for color management much don't support these."
msgstr ""

#: ../../general_concepts/colors/color_managed_workflow.rst:168
msgid "cLUT profiles work by holding tables of each color in a color space and their respective coordinates in a reference space. For CMYK this is typically L\\*A\\*B\\* and for the rest XYZ. These tables are tricky to make, which means these profiles are a lot rarer."
