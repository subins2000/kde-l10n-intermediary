msgid "As humans are the ones using computers, we have made it so that computers will give more room to darker values in the coordinate system of the image. We call this 'gamma-encoding', because it is applying a gamma function to the TRC or transfer function of an image. The TRC in this case being the Tone Response Curve or Tone Reproduction Curve or Transfer function (because color management specialists hate themselves), which tells your computer or printer how much color corresponds to a certain value."

msgid "If you look at linear of Rec. 709 TRCs, you can see there's quite a jump between the darker shades and the lighter shades, while if we look at the Lab L* TRC or the sRGB TRC, which seem more evenly spaced. This is due to our eyes' sensitivity to darker values. This also means that if you do not have enough bit depth, an image in a linear space will look as if it has ugly banding. Hence why, when we make images for viewing on a screen, we always use something like the Lab L\\*, sRGB or Gamma 2.2 TRCs to encode the image with."

Linear space is more physically correct, but sRGB is more efficient in terms of space, so hence why many images have an sRGB TRC encoded into them. In case this still doesn't make sense: *sRGB gives largely* **darker** *values than linear space for the same coordinates*."

msgid "The downside of linear space is of course that white seems very overpowered when mixing with black, because in a linear space, light grays get more room. In the end, while linear space is physically correct, and a boon to work in when you are dealing with physically correct renderers for videogames and raytracing, Krita is a tool and no-one will hunt you down for preferring the dark mixing of the sRGB TRC."
