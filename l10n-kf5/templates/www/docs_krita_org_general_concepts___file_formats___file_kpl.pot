msgid "Since 4.0, Krita has a new palette file-format that can handle colors that are wide gamut, RGB, CMYK, XYZ, GRAY, or LAB, and can be of any of the available bitdepths, as well as groups. These are Krita Palettes, or ``*.kpl``."

msgid "``*.kpl`` files are ZIP files, with two XMLs and ICC profiles inside. The colorset XML contains the swatches as ColorSetEntry and Groups as Group. The profiles.XML contains a list of profiles, and the ICC profiles themselves are embedded to ensure compatibility over different computers."
