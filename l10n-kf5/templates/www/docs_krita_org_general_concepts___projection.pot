msgid "The Perspective Projection tutorial is one of the Kickstarter 2015 tutorial rewards. It's about something that humanity has known scientifically for a very long time, and decent formal training will teach you about this. But I think there are very very few tutorials about it in regard to how to achieve it in digital painting programs, let alone open source."
