msgid "In the top-most field of the :guilabel:`Dimensions` tab, from the Predefined drop-down you can select predefined pixel sizes and PPI (pixels per inch). You can also set custom dimensions and the orientation of the document from the input fields below the predefined drop-down. This can also be saved as a new predefined preset for your future use by giving a name in the Save As field and clicking on the Save button. Below we find the Color section of the new document dialog box, where you can select the color model and the bit-depth. Check :ref:`general_concept_color` for more detailed information regarding color."

msgid "On the :guilabel:`Content` tab, you can define a name for your new document. This name will appear in the metadata of the file, and Krita will use it for the auto-save functionality as well. If you leave it empty, the document will be referred to as 'Unnamed' by default. You can select the background color and the amount of layers you want in the new document. Krita remembers the amount of layers you picked last time, so be careful."

msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/create_new_document.rst:71
msgid "These are separate categories where we deliver special defaults. Templates are just .kra files which are saved in a special location, so they can be pulled up by Krita quickly. You can make your own template file from any .kra file, by using :menuselection:`File --> Create Template From Image` in the top menu. This will add your current document as a new template, including all its properties along with the layers and layer contents."
