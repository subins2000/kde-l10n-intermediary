msgid "If you have your Krita version installed and you want to get a backtrace, it's best to download a portable version (either the latest release, or the one that someone told you to try, for example Krita Next or Krita Plus package). Alongside downloading the portable version, download the debug symbols package, too. It should be located in the same place you download Krita. You can see which is which by checking the end of the name of the zip file - debug symbols package always ends with `-dbg.zip`."

Portable zip and debug zip are found next to each other."
