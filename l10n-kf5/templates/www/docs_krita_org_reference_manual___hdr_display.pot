msgid "Since 4.2 Krita can not just edit high bitdepths images, but also render them on screen in a way that an HDR capable setup can show them as HDR images. HDR images, to put it simply, are images with really bright colors. They do this by having a very large range of colors available, 16 bit and higher, and to understand the upper range of the available colors as brighter than the brightest white most screens can show. HDR screens, in turn, are screens which can show brighter colors than most screens can show, and can thus show the super-bright colors in these HDR images. This allows for images where bright things, like fire, sunsets, magic, look really spectacular! It also shows more subtle shadows and has a better contrast in lower color values, but this requires a sharper eye."

msgid "Krita cannot show HDR with any given monitor, you will need an HDR capable setup. HDR capable setups are screens which can show more than 100 nits, preferably a value like 1000 and can show the rec 2020 PQ space. You will need to have the appropriate display cable(otherwise the values are just turned into regular SDR) and a graphics card which supports HDR, as well as suitable drivers. You then also need to configure the system settings for HDR."

msgid "If you can confirm that the system understands your setup as an HDR setup, you can continue your :ref:`configuration in Krita<hdr_display_settings>`, in :menuselection:`Settings --> Configure Krita --> Display`. There, you need to select the preferred surface, which should be as close to the display format as possible. Then restart Krita."
