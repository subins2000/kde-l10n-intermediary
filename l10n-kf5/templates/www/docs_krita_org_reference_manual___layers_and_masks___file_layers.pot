msgid "File Layers are references to files outside of the document: If the referenced document updates, the file layer will update. Do not remove the original file on your computer once you add it to Krita. Deleting your original image will break the file layer. If Krita cannot find the original file, it'll ask you where to find it. File layers cannot display animations."

msgid "If the imported layer and the image have a different resolution, it'll scale the filelayer by scaling its resolution. In other words, import a 600dpi A4 image onto a 300dpi A4 image, and the filelayer will be scaled to fit precisely on the 300dpi image. Useful for comics, where the ink-layer is preferred to be at a higher resolution than the colors."
