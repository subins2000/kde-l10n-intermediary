msgid "Local Selection masks let you remember and recall edit a selection on a layer. They work in a similar way to extra channels in other image editing programs. One difference is :program:`Krita's` ability to assign them to specific layers and activate a selection with a single click on the layer. Just click the round icon with the dotted outline on the local selection layer in the Layers docker."

msgid "A single layer can contain multiple Local Selection Masks. Repeating. A single layer can contain multiple Local Selection Masks (LSM). This is important because it means that you can, for instance, have several different outline parts of an image and save each as its own LSM and then recall it with a single click. Without using LSM you would have to create layer upon layer for each mask. Not only would this be inefficient for you but also for Krita and the program would slow down trying to keep up with it all. LSM's are one of the most important features in Krita!"

To do so, go into :menuselection:`Select --> Show Global Selection Mask`. The global selection, if you have anything selected, will now appear on the top of the layer stack as a selection mask."
