If you've got your brush and you know you're just going to be painting for awhile why not flip the dockers off?  You'd be amazed what a difference it makes while you're working.  However, if you know you're swapping out tools or working with layer or any of the other myriad things Krita lets you do then there's no point getting caught up in flipping the docks on and off.  Use you time wisely!"

This type of inclusion/exclusion interface has been around on PCs for decades so we don't need to go into great detail regarding its use.  What is important though is selecting the correct Toolbar to work on.  The :guilabel:`File` Toolbar allows you to add items between the :menuselection:`New` , :menuselection:`Open`  and :menuselection:`Save`  buttons as well as to the right of the :menuselection:`Save`  button.  The :guilabel:`Brushes and Stuff` Toolbar, lets you modify anything from the Gradients button over to the right.  This is probably where you'll do most of your editing."
