#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/display_settings.rst:30
msgid "**For Krita 3.3 or later:** On Windows, Krita also supports using Direct3D instead with the help of the ANGLE library. ANGLE works by converting the OpenGL functions that Krita makes use of to the equivalent in Direct3D. It may (or may not) be slower than native OpenGL, but it has better compatibility with typical Windows graphics drivers."
