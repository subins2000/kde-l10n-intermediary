msgid ":program:`Krita`, as a painting program, juggles a lot of data around, like the brushes you use, the colors you picked, but primarily, each pixel in your image. Due to this, how :program:`Krita` organizes where it stores all the data can really speed up :program:`Krita` while painting, just like having an organized artist's workplace can really speed up the painting process in real life."

msgid "RAM, or Random Access Memory, is the memory your computer is immediately using. The difference between RAM and the hard drive memory can be compared to the difference between having files on your desk and having files safely stored away in an archiving room: The files on your desk as much easier to access than the ones in your archive, and it takes time to pull new files from the archive. This is the same for your computer and RAM. Files need to be loaded into RAM before the computer can really use them, and storing and removing them from RAM takes time."

msgid "These settings allow you to choose how much of your virtual desk you dedicate to :program:`Krita`. :program:`Krita` will then reserve them on start-up. This does mean that if you change any of the given options, you need to restart :program:`Krita` so it can make this reservation."

msgid "A feature for advanced computer users. This allows :program:`Krita` to organize the area it takes up on the virtual working desk before putting its data on there. Like how a painter has a standard spot for their canvas, :program:`Krita` also benefits from giving certain data it uses its place (a memory pool), so that it can find them easily, and it doesn't get lost among the other data (memory fragmentation). It will then also not have to spend time finding a spot for this data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:34
msgid "Increasing this, of course, means there's more space for this type of data, but like how filling up your working desk with only one big canvas will make it difficult to find room for your paints and brushes, having a large internal pool will result in :program:`Krita` not knowing where to put the other non-specific data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:36
msgid "On the opposite end, not giving your canvas a spot at all, will result in you spending more time looking for a place where you will put the new layer or that reference you just took out of the storage. This happens for :program:`Krita` as well, making it slower."

msgid ":program:`Krita` also needs to keep all the Undo states on the virtual desk (RAM). Swapping means that parts of the files on the virtual desk get sent to the virtual archive room. This allows :program:`Krita` to dedicate more RAM space to new actions, by sending old Undo states to the archive room once it hits this limit. This will make undoing a little slower, but this can be desirable for the performance of :program:`Krita` overall. This too needs :program:`Krita` to be restarted."

msgid "Playing back a video at 25 FPS means that the computer has to precalculate 25 images per second of video. Now, video playing software is able to do this because it really focuses on this one single task. However, Krita as a painting program also allows you to edit the pictures. Because Krita needs to be able to do this, and a dedicated video player doesn't, Krita cannot do the same kind of optimizations as a dedicated video player can."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/preferences/performance_settings.rst:92
msgid "Still, an animator does need to be able to see what kind of animation they are making. To do this properly, we need to decide how Krita will regenerate the cache after the animator makes a change. There's fortunately a lot of different options how we can do this. However, the best solution really depends on what kind of computer you have and what kind of animation you are making. Therefore in this tab you can customize the way how and when the cache is generated."

This is only recommended for computers with a huge amount of RAM and animations that must show full-canvas full resolution 6k at 25 fps. If you do not have a huge amount (say, 64GiB) of RAM, do *not* use this option (and scale down your projects)."

Make sure you enable this option when using On-Disk storage backend, because On-Disk storage is a little slow. Without the limit, there's a good chance that it will not be able to render at full speed. Lower the size to play back faster at the cost of lower resolution."
