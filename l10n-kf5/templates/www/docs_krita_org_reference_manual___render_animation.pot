#: ../../reference_manual/render_animation.rst:21
msgid "For rendering to an animated file format, Krita will first render to a png sequence and then use FFmpeg, which is really good at encoding into video files, to render that sequence to an animated file format. The reason for this two-step process is that animation files can be really complex and really big, and this is the best way to allow you to keep control over the export process. For example, if your computer has a hiccup, and one frame saves out weird, first saving the image sequence allows you to only resave that one weird frame before rendering."
