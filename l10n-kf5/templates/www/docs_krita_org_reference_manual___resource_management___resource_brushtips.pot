msgid "For some time Photoshop has been using the ABR format to compile brushes into a single file.  Krita can read and load .ABR files, although there are certain features. For this example we will use an example of an .ABR file that contains numerous images of types of trees and ferns.  We have two objectives.  The first is to create a series of brushes that we an quickly access from the Brush Presets dock to easily put together a believable forest.  The second is to create a single brush that we can  change on the fly to use for a variety of flora, without the need to have a dedicated Brush Preset for each type."

msgid "It's time now to create the Brush Preview graphic. The simplest and easiest way to do this for a brush of this type is to clear out the ScratchPad using the :guilabel:`Reset` button. Now, center your cursor in the Brush Preview square at the top of the ScratchPad and click once. You should see an image of your texture (in this case it would be the evergreen tree). In order to work correctly though the entire image should fit comfortably within the square. This might mean that you have to tweak the size of the brush. Once you have something you are happy with then click the :guilabel:`Overwrite Brush` button and your brush and its preview image will be saved."
