msgid "Workspaces are basically saved configurations of dockers.  Each workspace saves how the dockers are grouped and where they are placed on the screen.  They allow you to easily move between workflows without having to manual reconfigure your setup each time.  They can be as simple or as complex as you want."

msgid "Workspaces can only be accessed via the toolbar or :menuselection:`Window --> Workspaces` There's no docker for them.  You can save workspaces, in which your current configuration is saved. You can also import them (from a \\*.kws file), or delete them (which black lists them)."

msgid "This treats the workspace in the first window as the 'primary' workspace, and when you switch focus, it will switch the secondary windows to that primary workspace. This is useful when the secondary workspace is a very sparse workspace with few dockers, and the primary is one with a lot of different dockers."
