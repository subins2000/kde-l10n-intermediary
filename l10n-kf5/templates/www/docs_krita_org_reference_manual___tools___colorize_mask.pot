msgstr ""

msgid "First, select the colorize mask editing tool while having the line art layer selected. |mouseleft| the canvas will add a colorize mask to the layer. You can also |mouseright| the line art layer, and then :menuselection:`Add --> Colorize Mask`. The line art will suddenly become really weird, this is the prefiltering which are filters through which we put the line art to make the algorithm easier to use. The tool options overview below shows which options control that."
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/tools/colorize_mask.rst:45
msgid "Now, you make strokes with brush colors, press :guilabel:`Update` in the tool options, or tick the last icon of the colorize mask properties.

msgid "We want to have the blue transparent. In the tool options of the colorize editing tool you will see a small palette. These are the colors already used. You can remove colors here, or mark a single color as standing for transparent, by selecting it and pressing \"transparent\". Updating the mask will still show the blue stroke, but the result will be transparent:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../reference_manual/tools/colorize_mask.rst:57
msgid "Because the colorize mask algorithm is slow, and we only need a part of our layer to be filled to fill the whole ghost lady figure, we can make use of :guilabel:`Limit to layer bounds`. This will limit Colorize Mask to use the combined size of the line art and the coloring key strokes. Therefore, make sure that the colorizing keystrokes only take up as much as they really need."

msgid "Now, the colorize mask, being a mask, can also be added to a group of line art layers. It will then use the composition of the whole group as the line art. This is perfect for our background which has two separate line art layers. It also means that the colorize mask will be disabled when added to a group with pass-through enabled, because those have no final composition. You can recognize a disabled colorize mask because its name is stricken through."
