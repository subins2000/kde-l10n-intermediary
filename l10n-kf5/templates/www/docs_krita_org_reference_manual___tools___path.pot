With an intermediate control point (i.e. a point that is not the starting point and not the ending point), you can move the direction handles separately to have the curve enter and leave the point in different directions. After editing a point, you can just click on the canvas to continue adding points to the curve."

Double-click the |mouseleft| on any point of the curve or press the :kbd:`Enter` key to finish drawing, or press the :kbd:`Esc` key to cancel the entire curve. You can use the :kbd:`Ctrl` key while keeping the |mouseleft| pressed to move the entire curve to a different position."
