msgid "So you've got a cool black on white drawing, and now you want to color it! The thing we’ll aim for in this tutorial is to get your line art colored in with flat colors. So no shading just yet. We’ll be going through some techniques for preparing the line art, and we’ll be using the layer docker to put each color on a separate layer, so we can easily access each color when we add shading."

msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:24
msgid "In traditional art, it is not uncommon to first draw the full background before drawing the subject. Or to first draw a line art and then color it in. Computers have a similar way of working."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:26
msgid "In programming, if you tell a computer to draw a red circle, and then afterwards tell it to draw a smaller yellow circle, you will see the small yellow circle overlap the red circle. Switch the commands around, and you will not see the yellow circle at all: it was drawn before the red circle and thus ‘behind’ it."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:28
msgid "This is referred to as the “drawing order”. So like the traditional artist, the computer will first draw the images that are behind everything, and layer the subject and foreground on top of it. The layer docker is a way for you to control the drawing order of multiple images, so for example, you can have your line art drawn later than your colors, meaning that the lines will be drawn over the colors, making it easier to make it neat!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:30
msgid "Other things that a layer stack can do are blending the colors of different layers differently with blending modes, using a filter in the layer stack, or using a mask that allows you to make parts transparent."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:32
msgid "Programmers talk about transparency as ''Alpha'', which is because the 'a' symbol is used to present transparency in the algorithms for painting one color on top of another. Usually when you see the word ''Alpha'' in a graphics program, just think of it as affecting the transparency."

msgid "The Multiply Blending Mode"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:47
msgid "So, typically, to get a black and white line art usable for coloring, you can set the blending mode of the line art layer to Multiply. You do this by selecting the layer and going to the drop-down that says **Normal** and setting that to **Multiply**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:52
msgid "And then you should be able to see your colors!"
msgstr ""

msgid "Multiply is not a perfect solution however. For example, if through some image editing magic I make the line art blue, it results into this:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:59
msgid "This is because multiply literally multiplies the colors. So it uses maths!"
msgstr ""

#: ../../tutorials/flat-coloring.rst:61
msgid "What it first does is take the values of the RGB channels, then divides them by the max (because we're in 8bit, this is 255), a process we call normalising. Then it multiplies the normalized values. Finally, it takes the result and multiplies it with 255 again to get the result values."
