msgid "You can also use animated brush tips to emulate, for example, bristle brush tips that go from very fine bristles to a fully opaque stamp based on pressure, like a dry paintbrush might do. To do this, you would follow the above instructions, but for each layer, create a different cross-section of the brush to correspond with the amount of pressure applied."
