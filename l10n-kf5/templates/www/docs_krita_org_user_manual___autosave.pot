msgid "Krita does its best to keep your work safe. But if you want to make sure that you won't lose work, you will need to understand how Saving, AutoSave and Backup Files work in Krita."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/autosave.rst:22
msgid "Krita does not store your images somewhere without your intervention. You need to save your work, or it will be lost, irretrievably. Krita can save your images in many formats. You should always save your work in Krita's native format, ``.kra`` because that supports all Krita's features."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/autosave.rst:25
msgid "Additionally, you can export your work to other formats, for compatibility with other applications or publication on the Web or on paper. Krita will warn which aspects of your work are going to be lost when you save to another format than ``.kra`` and offers to make a ``.kra`` file for you as well."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/autosave.rst:27
msgid "If you save your work, Krita will ask you where it should save on your computer. By default, this is the Pictures folder in your User folder: this is true for all operating systems."

msgid "If you use \"Save As\" your image will be saved under a new name. The original file under its own name will not be deleted. From now on, your file will be saved under the new name."

#: ../../user_manual/autosave.rst:45
msgid "AutoSave is what happens when you've worked for a bit and not saved your work yourself: Krita will save your work for you. Autosave files are by default hidden in your file manager. You can configure Krita 4.2 and up to create autosave files that are visible in your file manager. By default, Krita autosaves every fifteen minutes; you can configure that in the File tab of the General Settings page of the Configure Krita dialog, which is in the Settings menu (Linux, Windows) or in the Application menu (macOS)."
