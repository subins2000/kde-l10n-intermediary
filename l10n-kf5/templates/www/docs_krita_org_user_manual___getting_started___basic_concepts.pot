If you are new to digital painting medium, it is necessary that you first get yourself acquainted with the concepts of raster and :ref:`Vector <vector_graphics>` based images."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/getting_started/basic_concepts.rst:34
msgid "In digital imaging, a pixel (Picture Element) is a basic and lowest element of an Image. It is basically a grid of points each displaying specific color. Raster editing is manipulating and editing these pixels. For example when you take a 1-pixel brush which is colored black and painting on the white canvas in Krita you are actually changing the color of the pixel beneath your brush from white to black. When you zoom in and see a brush stroke you can notice many small squares with colors, these are pixels:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/getting_started/basic_concepts.rst:39
msgid "In contrast to raster images, vector graphic images are based on mathematical expressions. They are independent of the pixels. For example, when you draw a rectangle on a :ref:`vector layer <vector_layers>` in Krita you are actually drawing paths passing through points that are called nodes, which are located on specific coordinates on the 'x' and 'y' axes. When you re-size or move these points the computer calculates and redraws the path and displays the newly formed shape to you. Hence you can re-size the vector shape to any extent without any loss in quality. In Krita, everything which is not on a vector layer is raster based."

msgid "When painting traditionally, we use pigments which also absorb the right light-waves for the color we want it to have, but the more pigments you combine, the more light is absorbed, leading to a kind of murky black. This is why we call the mixing of paints **subtractive**, as it subtracts light the more pigments you put together. Because of that, in traditional pigment mixing, our most efficient primaries are three fairly light colors: Cyan blue and Magenta red and Yellow (CMY)."

msgid "A computer also uses three primaries and uses a specific amount of each primary in a color as the way it stores color. However, a computer is a screen that emits light.
