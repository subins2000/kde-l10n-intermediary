msgid "When you start Krita for the first time there will be no canvas or new document open by default. You will be greeted by a :ref:`welcome screen <welcome_screen>`, which will have option to create a new file or open existing document. To create a new canvas you have to create a new document from the :guilabel:`File` menu or by clicking on :guilabel:`New File`  under start section of the welcome screen. This will open the new file dialog box. If you want to open an existing image, either use :menuselection:`File --> Open` or drag the image from your computer into Krita's window."

The save option is in the same place as it is in all other computer programs: the top-menu of :guilabel:`File`, and then :guilabel:`Save`. Select the folder you want to have your drawing, and select the file format you want to use ('.kra' is Krita's default format, and will save everything). And then hit :guilabel:`Save`. Some older versions of Krita have a bug and require you to manually type the extension."
