#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:25
msgid "Think of an artwork or collage made with various stacks of papers with some paper cut such that they show the paper beneath them while some hide what's beneath them. If you want to replace an element in the artwork, you replace that piece of paper instead of drawing the entire thing. In Krita instead of papers we use **Layers**. Layers are part of the document which may or may not be transparent, they may be smaller or bigger than the document itself, they can arrange one above other, named and grouped."

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:34
msgid "Layers can give better control over your artwork for example you can re-color an entire artwork just by working on the separate color layer and thereby not destroying the line art which will reside above this color layer."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:39
msgid "You can edit individual layers, you can even add special effects to them, like Layer styles, blending modes, transparency, filters and transforms. Krita takes all these layers in its layer stack, including the special effects and combines or composites together a final image. This is just one of the many digital image manipulation tricks that :program:`Krita` has up its sleeve!"

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:66
msgid "These features save time and also help artists in maintaining the file with a layer stack which will be easy to understand for others who work on the same file. In addition to these layers and groups can both be labeled and filtered by colors, thus helping the artists to visually differentiate them."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:100
msgid "In Krita, the visible layers form a composite image which is shown on the canvas. The order in which Krita composites the layers is from bottom to top, much like the stack of papers we discussed above. As we continue adding layers, the image we see changes, according to the properties of the newly added layers on top. Group Layers composite separately from the other layers in the stack, except when pass through mode is activated. The layers inside a group form a composite image first and then this composite is taken into consideration while the layer stack is composited to form a whole image. If the pass through mode is activated by pressing the icon similar to bricked wall, the layers within the group are considered as if they are outside of that particular group in the layer stack, however, the visibility of the layers in a group depends on the visibility of the group."

msgid ".. image:: images/layers/Inherit-alpha-02.png"
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:131
msgid "It can be somewhat hard to figure out how the inherit alpha feature works in Krita for the first time. Once you click on the inherit alpha icon on the layer stack, the pixels of the layer you are painting on are confined to the combined pixel area of all the layers below it. That means if you have the default white background layer as first layer, clicking on the inherit alpha icon and painting on any layer above will seem to have no effect as the entire canvas is filled with white. Hence, it is advised to put the base layer that you want the pixels to clip in a group layer. As mentioned above, group layers are composited separately, hence the layer which is the lowest layer in a group becomes the bounding layer and the content of the layers above this layer clips to it if inherit alpha is enabled."

msgid "Krita supports non-destructive editing of the content of the layer. Non-destructive editing means editing or changing a layer or image without actually changing the original source image permanently, the changes are just added as filters or masks over the original image while keeping it intact, this helps a lot when your workflow requires constant back and forth. You can go back to original image with a click of a button. Just hide the filter or mask you have your initial image."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/layers_and_masks.rst:161
msgid "You can add various filters to a layer with Filter mask, or add Filter layer which will affect the whole image. Layers can also be transformed non-destructively with the transformation masks, and even have portions temporarily hidden with a Transparent Mask. Non-destructive effects like these are very useful when you change your mind later, or need to make a set of variations of a given image."
