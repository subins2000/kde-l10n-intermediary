msgid "In Krita 3.0, we now have functionality for Grids and Guides, but of course, this functionality is by itself not that interesting without snapping."
msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:21
msgid "Snapping is the ability to have Krita automatically align a selection or shape to the grids and guides, document center and document edges. For Vector layers, this goes even a step further, and we can let you snap to bounding boxes, intersections, extrapolated lines and more."

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:32
msgid "This will snap the cursor to the current grid, as configured in the grid docker. This doesn’t need the grid to be visible. Grids are saved per document, making this useful for aligning your art work to grids, as is the case for game sprites and grid-based designs."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user_manual/snapping.rst:40
msgid "This allows you to snap to guides, which can be dragged out from the ruler. Guides do not need to be visible for this, and are saved per document. This is useful for comic panels and similar print-layouts, though we recommend Scribus for more intensive work."
