msgid "Tags are how you organize common types of resources. They can be used with brushes, gradients, patterns, and even brush tips. You can select them from a drop-down menu above the resources. Selecting a tag will filter all the resources by that tag. Selecting the tag of :guilabel:`All` will show all resources.  Krita comes installed with a few default tags. You can create and edit your own as well. The tags are managed similarly across the different types of resources."
