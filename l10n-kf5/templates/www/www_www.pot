"predefined color schemes, improvements to the scripting interface and much "

"850 to 60. Outside of the coding sprint, work was done to create a new Quick "

"January 7, 2014. The KDE Community is proud to announce a Tech Preview of "
"KDE Frameworks 5. Frameworks 5 is the result of almost three years of work "

"Qt ecosystem a powerful set of drop-in libraries providing additional "
"functionality for a wide variety of tasks and platforms, based on over 15 "
"years of KDE experience in building applications. Today, all the Frameworks "

"Today, KDE releases Plasma 5.1.0, the first release containing new features "
"since the release of Plasma 5.0 this summer. Plasma 5.1 sports a wide "
"variety of improvements, leading to greater stability, better performance "
"and new and improved features. Thanks to the feedback of the community, KDE "
"developers were able to package a large number of fixes and enhancements "
"into this release, among which more complete and higher quality artwork "
"following the new-in-5.0 Breeze style, re-addition of popular features such "
"as the Icon Tasks taskswitcher and improved stability and performance.\n"
"</p><p>\n"
"Those travelling regularly will enjoy better support for time zones in the "
"panel's clock, while those staying at home a revamped clipboard manager, "
"allowing you to easily get at your past clipboard's content. The Breeze "
"widget style is now also available for Qt4-based applications, leading to "
"greater consistency across applications. The work to support Wayland as "
"display server for Plasma is still ongoing, with improved, but not complete "
"support in 5.1. <a href=\"https://community.kde.org/Plasma/5.1_Changes"
"\">Changes</a> throughout many default components improve accessibility for "
"visually impaired users by adding support for screenreaders and improved "
"keyboard navigation.\n"
"</p><p>\n"
"</p><p>\n"
"Aside from the visual improvements and the work on features, the focus of "
"this release lies also on stability and performance improvements, with over "
"180 bugs resolved since 5.0 in the shell alone. Plasma 5.1 requires <a href="
"\"https://www.kde.org/announcements/kde-frameworks-5.3.0.php\">KDE "
"Frameworks 5.3</a>, which brings in another great amount of fixes and "
"performance improvements on top of the large number of fixes that have gone "

"<a href='https://www.kde.org/fundraisers/yearend2014'>a donation</a> to KDE, "

"native widget style improves rendering of applications used in Plasma. This "
"new native style also works for Qt 4 letting applications written with KDE "

"Plasma 5.1 provides a core desktop with a feature set that will suffice for "

"can be addressed and fixed. We have compiled a <a href=\"https://community."
"kde.org/Plasma/5.1_Errata\">list of problems</a> we are aware of, and "
"working on. Users can expect monthly bugfix updates. A release bringing new "
"features and brinding back even more old features will be made in early "

"Members of the Plasma team have been working hard to continue making Plasma "
"a lightweight and responsive desktop which loads and runs quickly, but "
"remains full-featured with a polished look and feel.  We have spent the last "
"four months optimising startup and minimising memory usage, yielding faster "
"time-to-desktop, better runtime performance and less memory consumption.  "
"Basic features like panel popups were optimised to make sure they run "
"smoothly even on the lowest-end hardware.  Our design teams have not rested "
"either, producing beautiful new integrated lock and login screen graphics."

"<li>\n"
"<strong>Workflow improvements in the notification area</strong><br />\n"
"The notification area has been cleaned up, and sports a more integrated look "
